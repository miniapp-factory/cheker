Program Description: Risk Assessment Tool for Long/Short Trading

Overview
The Risk Assessment Tool is a lightweight software application designed to help traders evaluate the potential risk before entering long or short positions on cryptocurrency, forex, or stock exchanges. The program analyzes market data, calculates key risk metrics, and provides a clear recommendation based on the user’s risk tolerance and market conditions.

Key Features

Real-time Market Data Input

Accepts price data from an exchange API or manual input.

Displays current trend direction, volatility, and price momentum.

Risk Metrics Calculation

Stop-loss and take-profit ratio estimation

Risk-to-reward ratio

Volatility Index (based on ATR or standard deviation)

Position size calculator based on user-defined risk percentage

Long/Short Risk Evaluation

Identifies the likelihood of trend continuation or reversal

Provides a “risk score” for opening long or short positions

Highlights dangerous market conditions (e.g., low liquidity or high volatility spikes)

User Interface

Simple dashboard showing key metrics and recommendations

Green/Yellow/Red risk indicator for both long and short entries

Optional chart displaying recent price movement

Recommendations Engine

Suggests optimal entry zone, stop-loss level, and potential profit target

Warns the user if the risk-to-reward ratio is unfavorable

Supports different trading strategies (scalping, swing trading, day trading)

Target Users

Beginner traders who need guidance

Intermediate traders wanting quick risk evaluation

Algorithmic traders needing a simple risk module for strategy validation

Platform

Can be implemented as a desktop app (Python), web app (JavaScript), or mobile app.

If you'd like, I can also generate:
✅ project architecture
✅ code template (Python/JS)
✅ UI mockup
✅ full technical specification (ТЗ)
```

I need the current contents of `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to safely replace the title and description.  
Please add that file to the chat so I can generate the appropriate *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
